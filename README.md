# Unit 19 PWA Homework: Text Editor


## Description

PWA's - a web application that behaves like a native app - work in a browser and are optimised to improve not just performance but user experience!

This week, to demonstrate a PWA, I have built a text editor (starting with an exisiting application) that runs in a web browser but can also be installed and used offline. 


## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```


## Mock-Up

The following gif demonstrates the application functionality:




The following image shows the application's `manifest.json` file:



The following image shows the application's registered service worker:



The following image shows the application's IndexedDB storage:
